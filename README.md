osxmmkey - Mac OS X Media Keys support
--------------------------------------

The osxmmkey plugin adds support for media keys under mac; when enabled the 
standard play, next and previous buttons control quodlibet the way you'd
expect.

Requires the PyObjC, with the Cocoa and Quartz bindings to be installed. Under
macports, that's the `py27-pyobjc`, `py27-pyobjc-cocoa` and`py27-pyobjc-quartz`
ports, or equivalents for the python version used by quodlibet.

This plugin also requires that 'access for assistive devices' is enabled, see
the Universal Access preference pane in the OS X System Preferences.

**Note**: This plugin has been moved into core Quodlibet and this plugin
should no longer be needed.
