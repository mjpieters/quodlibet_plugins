osxmmkey - Mac OS X Media Keys support
--------------------------------------

The osxmmkey plugin adds support for media keys under mac; when enabled the 
standard play, next and previous buttons control quodlibet the way you'd expect.

Requires the PyObjC and Quartz bindings to be installed. Under macports, that's 
the `py27-pyobjc-quartz` and `py27-pyobjc` ports.
